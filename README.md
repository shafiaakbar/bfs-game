🧠 What’s This?
A visual playground where Breadth-First Search (BFS) comes alive. Watch an AI agent navigate a maze.

🎮 Core Features
🟦 BFS Agent
The little black square is your pathfinding prodigy. It explores the maze using the Breadth-First Search algorithm to find the shortest path from start to goal. It's not fast—but it’s guaranteed to be right.

👾 Manual Play Mode
Press P to switch from AI to you—yes, you with your “superior” brain. See if you can beat the AI’s path. Spoiler: humans panic under pressure.
